CORROSION-RESISTANT STEEL PRODUCTS FROM CHINA, INDIA, ITALY, KOREA, AND TAIWAN INJURE U.S. INDUSTRY, SAYS USITC
The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of corrosion-resistant steel products from China, India, Italy, Korea, and Taiwan that the U.S. Department of Commerce has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value and subsidized by the governments of China, India, Italy, and Korea.

All six Commissioners voted in the affirmative. 

As a result of the USITC¡¯s affirmative determinations, Commerce will issue a countervailing duty order on imports of these products from China, India, Italy, and Korea and antidumping duty orders on imports of these products from China, India, Italy, Korea, and Taiwan.

The Commission also made negative findings with respect to critical circumstances with regard to imports of these products from China, Italy, Korea, and Taiwan.  As a result, goods that entered the United States from China, Italy, and Korea prior to November 6, 2015, will not be subject to retroactive countervailing duties, and goods that entered the United States from China, Italy, Korea, and Taiwan prior to January 4, 2016, will not be subject to retroactive antidumping duties (dates are the dates of the Department of Commerce¡¯s affirmative preliminary determinations).

The Commission¡¯s public report Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products from China, India, Italy, Korea, and Taiwan (Investigation Nos. 701-TA-534-537 and 731-TA-1274-1278 (Final), USITC Publication 4620, July 2016) will contain the views of the Commission and information developed during the investigations.
